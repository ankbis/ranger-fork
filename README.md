# Ranger

Ranger.js is a small, standalone library for working with ranges of numbers in Javascript.

Ranger provides all the utility methods you'd expect, including `clamp`, `wrap`, `map`, and `random`.
These methods are available statically, as well as through a `Range` object that can be instantiated for repeated use.

Ranger's main feature is the ability to provide a 'curve' function to certain methods, which will affect how numbers are distributed.

``` js
import ranger from '@zadvorsky/ranger';

// this will return a float between 20 and 40
// when called repeatedly, the distribution of numbers will be approximately linear. 
ranger.random(20, 40);

// just an arbitrary easing function    
function expoEaseOut(x) {
  return 1.0 - Math.pow(2.0, -10.0 * x);
}

// this will also return a float between 20 and 40
// but the distribution will be heavily skewed towards the higher end of the range
ranger.random(20, 40, expoEaseOut);
``` 

The curve can be any function that takes a float between 0.0 and 1.0, and returns a transformed float.
Easing functions are a good example of this, but there are many [others](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DRJY_inVoAA5t7A.jpg:large).

Curves can be applied to `random`, `randomInt`, `map`, `divide`, among others.

Being able to apply easing any value in your application is a powerful way to give yourself more control over the visual output.

Ranger does not ship with any curves itself, but there are plenty of sources for them.

If you are using GSAP, you can access its easing functions directly like this:
``` js
ranger.random(20, 40, Expo.easeOut.getRatio);
```
## Usage

For the browser version, include `dist/ranger.umd.js` in a script tag.

For usage with NPM, run `npm install --save @zadvorsky/ranger`.
``` js
import ranger, { Range } from '@zadvorsky/ranger';

// creates a range {min: 0, max: 100}    
const range1 = new Range(0, 100);

range1.random(); // returns a float between range.min and range.max
range1.contains(101) // returns false

// Range has chainable transformation methods
// this line creates a range of {min: -10, max: 10} 
const range2 = range.clone().set(-1, 1).scale(10);

// maps a value from range 2 to range 1    
range2.map(-5, range1); // returns 25     

// static method
ranger.map(-5, range2, range1) // same as above

// crates a range with expoEaseOut as the default curve.  
const range3 = new Range(0, 100, expoEaseOut);
```

Documentation can be found [here](http://ranger-docs.surge.sh/).

Examples can be found [here](http://ranger-examples.surge.sh/).

## Build

To build locally, run
``` sh
npm install
npm run dev
```
This project uses Rollup to bundle the library.

## Build examples

To build the es6 example application, run
``` sh
cd examples/es6
npm install
npm run start
```

The example application uses WebPack 4. It has a bunch of boilerplate code, and uses GSAP for animations.

The actual example code can be found in `examples/es6/src/js/examples`.
